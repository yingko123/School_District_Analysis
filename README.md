# School District Analysis<br>

## Overview of the school district analysis:<br>
Using tools in the Pandas library, we analyized school and student academic data of the PyCity school district.  The analysis focus on whether there are correlation between academic performance and school type, funding ,and size.  We then look at if academic data of Thomas High School's ninth graders contain any signs of academic dishonesty by replacing the scores in question with NaN. 

## Results:
